Project Summary
# bracUnite

## Features Outline

- bracUnite is the exclusive app for BRAC University members to connect, collaborate, and thrive within BRAC Universityâ€™s vibrant community. It's super safe, using email to make sure only the right people can log in. There are three kinds of users: Alumni (old students), Students (current students), and Faculty (teachers). Once you sign up, you can do lots of cool stuff. You can check out other people's profiles and see a table with all their info, like what they like, what they're studying, where they live, and more. This helps you find people with similar interests and connect with them through email or other ways. 

- There's a tool that makes making your CV really easy. It grabs info from your profile and makes a CV for you. And if you're up for some fun, there's a game called "Doge game" in the games corner. 

- For students who go the same way after classes, there's a ride-sharing feature. You can ask for rides from others who take the same route. They get a notification with your picture, phone number, and email, so it's easy to connect.

- If you and other students have the same classes in a semester, there's a cool feature that lets you see what courses they're taking. This way, you can connect with classmates and maybe even study together.

- You can also know about BRAC University clubs and projects through static pages on the website. These pages are like hubs for info and help you get involved. BracUnite is all about making connections, sharing what you know, and making university life even better through this online community, and many more.
